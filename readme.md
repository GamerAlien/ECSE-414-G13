:smiley: Floyd Warshall Algorithm
-------------

Contains 3 methods:
> -  **floydwarshall(graph) :  ** Returns 2 2-dimensional arrays __pred__ and __dist__. 
	__pred__ contains the predecessors on the shortest path.
	__dist__ contains the shortest distances from each vertex
> - **getFloydWarshallResults(graph): :  ** Prints the shortest distances between each vertex
> - **main  :** creates a dummy graph and tests the output (TO BE REPLACED BY GENERATED ARRAY)
